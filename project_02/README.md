# In-Palm 2DoF Manipulator PCB
Implementation files (gerber, schematic, BOM, etc.) for generating a PCB for the manipulator

## Project Description
In-the-palm 2DoF manipulator that will be worn on both the forearm and hand. This device will be comprised of an active surface (i.e. a pulley belt) and turntable that will be actuated by two micro DC motors. The control of this device will be actuated by four pressure sensors that will be inlaid along the wrist to measure the bend of the wrist. Depending on the bend of the wrist, either the turntable or active surface will turn on and move.

## PCB Description
The components for this board is a PocketBeagle, L293D, and MT3608. They are connected together through a 4-layer, copper board and has 5mm mounting brackets inset in the corners.
